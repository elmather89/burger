# It's Burger Time!
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. A user can submit a burger that will then be populated to the left side of the page. Then the user can 'devour' the burger of their choice. This app stores every burger in a database, devoured or not.

### Built with:
* Handlebars
* Javascript
* MySQL
* Node
* Express
* A homemade ORM
* Heroku (hosting the app)
